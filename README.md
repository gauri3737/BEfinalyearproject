Deepfake-image-detection-using-dense-CNN-Architecture
Our project aims to develop an efficient solution for detecting deepfake images using advanced deep learning techniques and specialized neural network architectures. Leveraging the power of EfficientNetV2B0 architecture implemented in TensorFlow and Keras, this solution is designed to efficiently classify images as either authentic or manipulated. The Streamlit interface provides a user-friendly platform for uploading images and receiving instant authenticity feedback, enhancing accessibility for users.
